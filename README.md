# Show the local weather

A project for Free Code Camp
---

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

1. User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
2. User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

### FCC recommends using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.

I have also been considering:
* (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?MR=1)[Weather Underground]
* and (https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/#js=)[Yahoo's Weather API]

### Other APIs

Geolocation, if not provided by the weather API, will need to be gatheredit through either the user's browser or using something like (https://www.iplocation.net/)[IPLocation]
